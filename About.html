    <h1>A brief origin story</h1>


<p>
    My Irish forefathers put root down in Boston. 
    My great-grandfather Dan "Porky" Flynn boxed his way through stiff heavyweight competition, earning title fights against the best in the world, including legend Jack Dempsey.
    Through a series of events, perhaps CTE-related, the family ended up in New Jersey. My time there was short-lived.
    I grew up in Fowlerville, Michigan and studied Spanish at Grand Valley State University. 
    I am now a homeowner in Detroit, 
    working for the Rock FOC as I continue to learn learning about its many resources and impacts in Greater Detroit.
